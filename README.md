# `matplotlib` guide
This is a guide to `matplotlib` aimed at 2nd year Physics undergraduates at the University of Manchester. It emphasises core functionality and a few useful routines to go from novice to generating simple but publishable plots quickly. 

A few different versions are available here. 

- The .ipynb is the original Jupyter Notebook which the guide was written in. If you download and run this (see below), you will be able to play around with the codes directly. **If you want to quickly view the guide, click on this one**.

- Download and open the .html file in a browser for a nicely presented version with working clickable links. 

If you haven't come across Jupyter Notebooks before, go to https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html to find out how to run one on your machine!
