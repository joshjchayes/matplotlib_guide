# `matplotlib` guide
This is a guide to `matplotlib` aimed at 2nd year Physics undergraduates at the University of Manchester. It emphasises core functionality and a few useful routines to go from novice to generating simple but publishable plots quickly. 

A few different versions are available here. 

- The .ipynb is the original iPython (Jupyter) notebook which the guide was written in. If you run this, you will be able to play around with the codes directly

- Download and open the .html file in a browser for a nicely presented version with working clickable links.
